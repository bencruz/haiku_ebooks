web scraper + haiku maker + twitter bot = haiku_ebooks

results of the original version: https://twitter.com/haiku_ebooks

re-writing the code as an exercise in "test-first" principles.


GOALS:

1. Be able to get syllable counts for words/strings, 
analyze strings to see if they can fit into a 5/7/5 format, 
scan text for instances of haikus,
save haikus to file.

2. Be able to scrape the web and receive text,
search that text for haikus or #s of syllables,
re-scrape the web based on the text/haiku built thus far.

3. Be able to tweet haikus that have been found, at some sort of non-annoying interval (once a day?)
