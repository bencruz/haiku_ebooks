https://twitter.com/haiku_ebooks

basically it is a monkey patch on Strings so that they know whether or not they are haikus (#haiku?)

uses a modified version of the CMU pronunciation dictionary for syllable counts

TweetStream creates a tweet stream and Twitter.update(s) whenever it finds a haiku

TO USE:

1. put yr API token thingies into the web_scraper.rb file
2. ruby Haiku.rb
3. watch it do its thang


todo:
EITHER
make it format the tweet.text with /'s(i.e, "line1/line2/line3")
OR
make it retweet rather than post text.
