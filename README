(HAIKU_EBOOKS: THE POETRY ROBOT)[https://twitter.com/haiku_ebooks]

# A ROBOT THAT SCANS TWITTER FOR TWEETS THAT ARE HAIKUS AND THEN RETWEETS THEM.

basically it is a monkey-patch on Strings so that they know whether or not they are haikus (#haiku?).
uses a modified version of the CMU pronunciation dictionary for syllable counts.

* You can also use string.rb, syllable_dictionary.txt, and syllable_dictionary.rb 
* to incorporate String#haiku? and String#syllable_count into something else.

A whole ton of haikus are tweeted all the time...
by removing these tweets from the tweetstream
and placing them into an artistic-poetic context,
it elevates the content of the tweet into something more than itself.

TODO:
technically a haiku is supposed to refer in some way to the current season, 
so perhaps including 4 filess filled with words vaguely connected to a season,
and reject tweets that don't include one of the words listed for that time of year. 

Improve String#haiku? to reject haikus that have odd line breaks. 
(possibly just make sure that the last word in any line/stanza(?) is not %w(of the then and but...etc.))
