(HAIKU_EBOOKS: THE POETRY ROBOT)[https://twitter.com/haiku_ebooks]

# A ROBOT THAT SCANS TWITTER FOR TWEETS THAT ARE HAIKUS AND THEN RETWEETS THEM.

basically it is a monkey-patch on Strings so that they know whether or not they are haikus.
uses a modified version of the CMU pronunciation dictionary for syllable counts.

NEW AND IMPROVED TO FIND BETTER HAIKUS!
