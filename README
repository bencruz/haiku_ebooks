ROBOT THAT SCANS TWITTER FOR TWEETS THAT ARE HAIKUS AND THEN RETWEETS THEM.

basically it is a monkey-patch on Strings so that they know whether or not they are haikus (#haiku?)

uses a modified version of the CMU pronunciation dictionary for syllable counts.

TO USE:

1. put yr API token thingies into the web_scraper.rb file
2. ruby Haiku.rb
3. watch it do its thang
